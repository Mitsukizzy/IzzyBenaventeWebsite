             ElemenTerra is one of five Advanced Game Projects developed at USC during the 2014-2015 school year. 
             It is a virtual reality world-building game using the Oculus Rift and Sixense STEM. 
             As of March 2016, ElemenTerra has been funded by Starbreeze Studios and is being developed by the team leads at Freeform Labs!

             While the game was an AGP, I developed an intuitive movement system using the Oculus Rift and Razer Hydra and programmed radial gravity and flight mechanics in Unity using C#.
            <br /><br />
            
            I worked on many player-related functions including movement, flight, and planting. My favorite task
            was figuring out the best way to have the player experience flight and movement using
            both the Oculus and the Hydra. It was a great user experience challenge that took a few weeks
            to final solve and implement. We went through heavy code review phase halfway through the project 
            and worked on the game together for a full school year. The team leads went on to create a
            company called Freeform Labs and continue to develop and demo ElemenTerra at various expos.
